Using flexboxes, and different CSS properties. I have created a portfolio according to the instructions provided in class.

This is my feeble attmept of creating a website from scratch. I do not like flex boxes or anything that has to do with styling an HTML document. 

I spent around 20+ hours trying to cobble together all the elements I had learned in class. I know it looks terrible and the functionality is poor, but it is time for me to move on to logic based development. This was my best attempt for now but in the future my layouts will be a lot better.

The main elements in this document are the nav bar, the hover effects of the buttons, the hero picture, the about me section, the hover effects of the images in the work section, the use of flex boxes for the work section, and the contact me section on the bottom.

Included is a gif of what the page looks like:
